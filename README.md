## ðŸ“¦ Development & Production Using Docker

### Prerequisites
1. Docker Engine installed (or an equivalent containerization platform, e.g., Podman).
2. _(Optional: Easier setup)_ Docker Compose configured (or an equivalent tool for the installed platform, e.g., Podman Compose).

### Development Container

The development container allows you to modify files on your machine using your preferred editor while running a fully functional development environment. All dependencies are installed automatically with a single command.

**Use Docker Compose**

Run the following command to start the `dev` container:

```sh
docker-compose up -d dev
```
**What This Does:**
- Builds the `portfolio:dev` image using the `development` target from the Dockerfile.
- Mounts the current directory (`.`) to `/app` inside the container, enabling real-time synchronization of changes.
- Exposes port `8090` on your local machine and maps it to port `8000` in the container.
- Starts the container named `portfolio_dev` in the background.


### Production Container

The web container runs the production version of your application. It provides a lightweight environment optimized for serving your website to end users.

**Use Docker Compose**

Run the following command to start the `web` container in detached mode:

```sh
docker-compose run -p 8080:80 web
```
**What This Does:**
- Builds the `portfolio:prod` image using the production target from the Dockerfile.
- Maps port `8080` (this can be adjusted) on your local machine to port `80` in the container.
- Starts the container named `portfolio_web` in the background.

## ðŸ›  Installation & Set Up

   ```sh
   nvm install
   ```

3. Install dependencies

   ```sh
   yarn
   ```

4. Start the development server

   ```sh
   npm start
   ```

## ðŸš€ Building and Running for Production

1. Generate a full static production build

   ```sh
   npm run build
   ```

1. Preview the site as it will appear once deployed

   ```sh
   npm run serve
   ```
